:description: |
  Services are applications running in the background doing continuous work
  or waiting for requests to do work.
  The scope determines which services are configured to be started in which
  runlevel. It uses the `chkconfig` command to obtain that information.
  The xinetd services that are also displayed by `chkconfig` are switched
  on/off by editing config files and are ignored in this context.
