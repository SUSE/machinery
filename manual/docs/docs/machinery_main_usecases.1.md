# Use Cases

Some of the important use cases of Machinery are:

* Inspecting a System and Collecting Information

  Collecting a variety of information. Limit the gathered
  information with scopes (see section about scopes). Each inspection step
  updates the system description.

* Reviewing System Description

  After a successful inspection, the system description can be displayed on
  the console or the output can be fed into other tools.

* Cloning a System

  An inspected system can be cloned. The inspection step returns a system
  description which is used as the basis for cloning physical or virtual
  instances. Machinery can build a system image from the description, which
  can then for example be deployed to a cloud environment.
